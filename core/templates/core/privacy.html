                <p>(Enacted Pursuant to S.C. Code Section 30-2-10 et. seq.)*</p>
                <p>The University is a complex agency which has a variety of legitimate public purposes encompassing
                    teaching, research and extension. It is in the University's best interest to promote and support
                    affiliated foundations and entities. In some cases the University’s interests can be served by
                    providing goods and services to its students, parents, alumni and employees. The University provides
                    much of this support and many services internally; however there are a number of supportive
                    functions which for various reasons are performed by affiliated entities or private contractors.</p>
                <p>To this end, the university will implement the Family Privacy Protection Act (FPPA) as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>. It shall be the responsibility of the Office of Institutional
                        Research to implement compliance with the FPPA, and specifically Section 30-2-40 A.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>. The university will engage in an ongoing evaluation to ensure that
                        the personal information it gathers in its various programs is necessary for the performance of
                        the university’s legitimate public purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Rights</strong>. The university will continue to inform all persons from whom
                        the university collects personal information (hereinafter, ‘affected persons’) of their rights
                        under applicable laws, including the South Carolina Personal Privacy Protection Act (SC Code
                        Section 30-2-10 et. seq.) and the Family Educational and Right to Privacy Act (20 USC 1232g), as
                        appropriate.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Campus Directory Information</strong>. The university has determined that publication of
                        its annual campus telephone directory is a business necessity. The university will release this
                        directory to third parties only after notifying the requestor that the information therein may
                        not be used for commercial solicitation and receiving written acknowledgement that the material
                        will not be used for commercial solicitation. The telephone directory and any Web directories
                        containing personal information will contain the warnings referred to in Section 30-2-50 of the
                        FPPA.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Foundations and Affiliated Entities</strong>. The university will release necessary
